## Usage:

This is a quite simple command line application

arguments:
- -a, --arrange - Provide a problem in a string format such as '5 + 10' or '1 - 10'. Remember to include spaces between integers and operand.
- -o, --output - Probide a boolean which controls if the calculation will be outputted to the screen.

### Motivation:

This software was made as a part of a free course available on https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/
I use it as a deliberate practice to revisit some basic concepts so I might possibly get a different perspective on how things might be done.
